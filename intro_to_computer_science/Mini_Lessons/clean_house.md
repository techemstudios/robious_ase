# Clean the Whole House  

Your house is a mess, i.e. your bedroom, kitchen, living room, and garage. You have the task of cleaning the whole house by a certain time, the end of the day. You look everything over in your head and think, "That's a lot!". At first, this may seem like an unmanageable task. However, we can take an approach to solve the problem like a computer scientist might.  

## Analysis  
### Ask Questions  

What is the problem? Every room in the house is a mess. Are there any special cases? We have one day to clean the whole house. How will we know when the problem is solved? When every room in the house is clean.  

## Look for Familiar Things  
### Recognize Patterns  

Determine if there are any patterns. Maybe you have been in a situation like this before. You have probably cleaned at least one room before... How did you do it then? Then, you just had one room to clean, and done.  

## Decomposition  
### Divide & Conquer  

Break up the problem into smaller, attackable (manageable) problems. Just worry about one room to clean, finish it, then move on to the next. Mapping this out could help.

## Algorithm Design  
### Make a Plan  

Design a step-by-step process that potentially solves problem, then carry it out.
