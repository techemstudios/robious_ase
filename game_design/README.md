# Robious: Game Design  

Thursdays, 4:00pm - 5:00pm   

Have a *template* game already on the iPads labeled the school name. This will already have programmed: character movement, point system; as well as partial level design i.e. platform, mini obstacles, different paths to take, collectibles.  

#### Objectives  
Students will be able to -  
* Have a general intro to programming  
* Know how to approach designing a game with Design Thinking  
* Be able to solve most problems on their own in Hyperpad app  
* Have a finished, or at least good start to a game  

## Introduction  
Depending on the experience/age level, this class will use the app, Hyperpad and/or Hopscotch to get an intro to game design. The concept of **design thinking** will be the main focus throughout the session. Design thinking is a user-centered approach to design in general.  

## Core Computer Science Concepts  
### A.K.A. Buzz Words  

* Computational Thinking
  * Decomposition
    - Decompose: break down: divide & conquer
    - Break down a problem into smaller problems
  * Generalize
    - Be able to see the big picture
    - See how the smaller tasks make up the larger task
  * Recognize Patterns
    - Look for familiar things
    - Be able to see parts that repeat
    - Don't Repeat Yourself --> **DRY**
  * Algorithm Design
    - Make a plan to tackle the problem
    - Carry out the plan

* Abstraction
  * Mental model, or way to think about something
    - Focus on what needs to be done in the moment
    - Leave only the information we need, to complete our goal

* Object Oriented Programming
  * OOP or OOD
    - Everything is an object having its own, or similar properties to other objects
    - Each object belongs to a *class*

### How to Think
#### Like a Computer Scientist
*10 min*

Take a problem that at first, may seem overwhelming, or not "attackable" with a program, then break the problem into smaller manageable problems where we can use computation to solve. See how the smaller problems together make up the larger one. Think about computational thinking as useful ways to approach and solve problems using these steps: decomposition, generalization, recognize patterns, make plan (or algorithm) and carry it out.

Example, Clean the Whole House problem.

### Abstraction

When we are working in one layer, we do not need to concern ourselves with the information in the surrounding layers. This way, we can just focus on what needs to be done in the moment. Think of abstraction as a mental model; a way to think about something. Have the unnecessary details hidden, so we can leave only the information we need to complete our goal.

Abstraction Examples:

* A Person Driving a Car
  - The only thing they need to focus on is the road ahead.
  - It is unnecessary to worry about details of how the engine or electronics of the car work.

* Fast Food Restaurant
  - At many restaurants, the names of meals have corresponding numbers.
  - The food prep has been trained to recognize the meal number, not worry about the full name.

### Object Oriented Programming

As we talked about decomposing (divide and conquer) and generalization (seeing the big picture) in computational thinking, object oriented in a nutshell is to look at the interaction of simple *objects*, as being part of a complex system. Each object does something, it has its own set of properties and attributes (things it can do) and belongs to a *Class*. Let's look at an example of a dog named, Scrappy. We can say, Scrappy is a specific individual in a larger class, Dogs. In Object Oriented terms, Scrappy is a particular *instance* of the dog class. Since Scrappy is part of the dog class, we can assume certain things about him. Scrappy most likely has four legs, a tail, a wet nose, an age, and can bark. Now take a dog named, Lassy. She will have similar characteristics, but may only differ in behavior, size, or color. So, every object is an instance of some class. The class describes the general characteristics (or properties) an instance will have. The instance of the class will hold more specific properties and attributes.
